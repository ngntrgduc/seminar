My Seminar coursework at University of Science - VNUHCM, 2024.

 - Topic: Handling Missing Data (Xử lý dữ liệu khuyết)
 - Language: Vietnamese
 - Supervisor: Dr. Hoang Van Ha
<!-- Graded:  -->

### Overview
In this course, I rephrase and try to understand the paper 
["NeuMiss networks: differentiable programming for supervised learning with missing values"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/42ae1544956fbe6e09242e6cd752444c-Abstract.html) (NeurIPS 2020). 
Though the paper still contains some small errors, this is still an interesting work that focuses on handling missing data in linear regression problems by using a Neural network, so-called NeuMiss.
